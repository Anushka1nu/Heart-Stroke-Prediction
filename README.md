# Heart-Stroke-Prediction
The project aim is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of stroke based on their demographic and health-related features.
The "Heart Stroke Prediction" project is centered around anticipating the probability of stroke occurrence in patients. It achieves this by analyzing a range of input factors including gender, age, medical history, and smoking habits. 

Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN, it constructs a model that identifies individuals at risk of stroke based on their demographic and health-related attributes. This approach empowers early detection of high-risk individuals, facilitating timely preventive measures to mitigate the impact and frequency of strokes.
